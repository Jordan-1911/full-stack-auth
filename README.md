# Full-Stack Authentication with Vue.js, Spring Boot, and Spring Security

This repository contains a simple front end with Spring Boot/Java backend, most notably to demonstrate and understand the implementation of the new Spring Security and its workings under the hood.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16.0 or higher
- [Java 17](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/) or higher

### Running the application

To run the application, you need to start the backend and the frontend. You can do this by running each application in a separate terminal.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You can run both applications at once by using the script `run.sh` in the root directory.
